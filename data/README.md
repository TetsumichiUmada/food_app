# Food-101 dataset

We use [Food-101](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) dataset published by Lukas Bossard, Matthieu Guillaumin, Luc Van Gool. 

The dataset contains 101 food categories with 101,000 images. For each class, 250 manually reviewed test images are provided as well as 750 training images. The training images were not cleaned on purpose, and thus still contain some amount of noise

The notebook, `0_dataset.ipynb` has a code to download the dataset and set up the directories (training, validation, and test sets)
